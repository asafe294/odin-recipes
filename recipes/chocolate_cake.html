        Brewed coffee helps to enhance the chocolate flavor in this cake while 
        sour cream delivers moisture and richness to the batter — no wonder it's a 5-star recipe.

        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup 2% milk</li>
        <li>1 cup brewed coffee</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to <strong>325 degrees F (165 degrees C)</strong>. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan; dust pan with 2 teaspoons cocoa powder or as needed.</li>
        <li>Whisk cake flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix sugar and canola oil in a mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Beat eggs into sugar and oil, one at a time, blending in the first egg before adding the second. Gradually beat milk, coffee, and vanilla extract into sugar mixture until smooth.</li>
        <li>Reduce mixer speed to low and beat flour mixture into wet ingredients. Stir sour cream into batter. Pour into prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 40 minutes.</li>
